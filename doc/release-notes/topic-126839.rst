=============================
Upgrading Contrail 4.1 to 5.0
=============================

This section provides the process for upgrading an existing Contrail Release 4.1 system to Contrail Release 5.0.

   -  `Upgrade Assumptions`_ 


   -  `Upgrade Procedure`_ 




Upgrade Assumptions
===================

This upgrade procedure assumes the following.

   - The initial cluster (4.0.x) was provisioned using Server Manager.


   - The OpenStack SKU is the same in the “from” and “to” versions.


   - A backup has been made of the analytics database, see.




Upgrade Procedure
=================


#. Make a backup of the analytics database, because the upgrade procedure removes the analytics database information, see.



#. Add the new Contrail 4.1 Debian image to the Server Manager JSON used for provisioning.

    ``server-manager add image –f contrail_image.json`` 



#. Upgrade the cluster by reprovisioning the cluster with the new image.

   - For an all-in-one, single-node demo system:

       ``server-manager provision—-cluster_id <all_in_one_cluster> combined_image_mainline`` 


   - For a multinode system:

       ``server-manager provision —-cluster_id <multi_node> combined_image_mainline`` 




#. Monitor progress of the provisioning by observing cluster status or log entries.

   - Cluster status: ``server-manager display server --cluster_id <cluster_id> --select "id,ip_address,roles,status"`` 


   - Log entries: /var/log/contrail-server-manager/debug.log


  .. note:: Log entries from the previous version are lost in the upgrade process.
