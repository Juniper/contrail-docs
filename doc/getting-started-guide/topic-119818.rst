Installing Containerized Contrail Using Server Manager Lite (SM-Lite)
=====================================================================

Server Manager Lite (SM-Lite) is a streamlined version of Server Manager. SM-Lite has functionality similar to Server Manager, except it does not perform reimaging. SM-Lite is typically used for Contrail networking only.

You can use Contrail Server Manager or Server Manager Lite (SM-Lite) to provision containerized Contrail. To use SM-Lite for provisioning, you install regular Server Manager, then use SM-Lite commands for provisioning.

This topic is the procedure for installing and provisioning Contrail 4.0 and later using SM-Lite.

The SM-Lite installation of containerized Contrail is completed using the following major activities:

   -  `Preparing for SM-Lite Installation`_ 


   -  `Installing SM-Lite`_ 


   -  `Provisioning Contrail Using SM-Lite`_ 


   -  `Sample JSONs and Testbed.py`_ 




Preparing for SM-Lite Installation
==================================

For Contrail 4.0, SM-Lite install is only supported on Ubuntu 14.04.5. Contrail 4.1 adds support for Ubuntu 16.04.2.

Before installing containerized Contrail, you must install Server Manager SM-Lite on a server running a supported version of Ubuntu.

You can install SM-Lite on any server or node, and you can run it using multiple options:

   - Use a single node or VM to provision Contrail, then install SM-Lite on the same node and perform Contrail provisioning.


   - Use a separate node or VM to install SM-Lite, and provision Contrail with the rest of the nodes.


   - Use a node or VM that has Contrail roles (typically a config node) to install SM-Lite.


To specify servers and associated Contrail roles and cluster details, you can use either a ``testbed.py`` or JSONs based on the sample JSONs used with regular Server Manager. The image details come from the image JSON.



Prerequisites
-------------

Before installing the SM-Lite package, ensure the following cautions have been met:

   - Ensure that the ``sources.list`` is present and empty.


   - Ensure that ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`` is not pointing to any external or local repositories.

  
  If you are installing SM-Lite on a VM spawned from OpenStack Horizon or from an Ubuntu cloud image:

   - Verify that the VM is set up correctly with hostname and domain details:

     - The hostname and domain name are present in ``/etc/hosts`` as follows:

       ``<Host non mgmt IP> <server hostname>.<domain_name> <server hostname>`` 


     - The domain name is present in ``/etc/resolv.conf`` as follows:

       ``search <domain_name>`` 



   - When correctly set up, the command ``"hostname -f"`` will return ``< hostname >.< domain_name >`` 




Installing SM-Lite
==================


#. Install the regular Server Manager wrapper package (Debian).( An example package is: ``contrail-server-manager-installer_2.22~juno_all.deb`` .)

   ``dpkg –i </github-build/mainline/<build_number> /ubuntu-14-04/mitaka/artifacts/ contrail-server-manager-installer_4.0.0.0-<build-number>~mitaka_all.deb>`` 



#. Now you can use the SM-Lite ``provision_containers`` command to provision Contrail.

   The full syntax and available options of the ``provision_containers.sh`` script:

::

 Help:
 `/opt/contrail/contrail_server_manager/provision_containers.sh -h`  
 `-h --help`  
 `-cj <cluster json path>` 
 `-sj <server json path>`
 `-ij <image json path>`
 `-t|--testbed <testbed.py path>`
 `-c <contrail cloud docker package path>`
 `-cid|--cluster-id <cluster-id>`  
 `-ni|--no-install-sm-lite`

The ``-ni`` option is used to reprovision an existing cluster, create a new cluster, or upgrade an existing cluster with a different version.

Provisioning Contrail Using SM-Lite
===================================

To activate SM-Lite and provision the target systems, use ``provision_containers.sh`` along with system-specific configuration information.

Provision Contrail with system-specific configuration information using one of the following options:

   - Using JSONs

    ``/opt/contrail/contrail_server_manager/provision_containers.sh -cj<cluster json path>-sj<server json path>-ij<image json path>--cluster-id<Cluster ID>`` 


   - Using ``testbed.py`` and ``contrail-docker-cloud.tgz`` 

    ``/opt/contrail/contrail_server_manager/provision_containers.sh -t<testbed.py path>-c<contrail-cloud-docker tgz path>--cluster-id<Cluster ID>`` 


The SM-Lite provisioning logs can be viewed at ``/var/log/contrail-server-manager/debug.log`` .

Running the ``provision_containers.sh`` script does the following:

   - Installs SM-Lite components: sm client, sm webui, sm monitoring/inventory, and the like.


   - Prepares the targets for provisioning by running the ``preconfig.py`` script.


   - Adds Server Manager objects for cluster, server, and image from the JSONs or the ``testbed.py`` as provided.


   - Loads Docker containers and pushes them to the registry in the background.


   - Launches the Contrail provisioning, using the Server Manager client CLI.




Sample JSONs and Testbed.py
===========================

Use the SM-Lite command ``provision_containers.sh`` with a JSON file or a ``testbed.py`` to provision Contrail objects.

Configure an appropriate JSON file or ``testbed.py`` with the IP addresses, interface names, and password strings specific to your system, then identify its path when you use the SM-Lite ``provision_containers.sh`` command.

Select a sample JSON or testbed.py from the following and update it to match your system:

   -  `Sample testbed.py for Provisioning Containers with SM-Lite`_  


   -  `Sample JSONs for an All-In-One-Node Cluster (for demo)`_  


   -  `Sample JSONs for a Multinode Cluster with Two Nodes`_  


   -  `Sample JSONs for a Multinode Cluster with 7 Nodes and High Availability`_
