ECMP Load Balancing in the Service Chain
========================================



Traffic flowing through a service chain can be load-balanced by distributing traffic streams to multiple service virtual machines (VMs) that are running identical applications. This is illustrated in `Figure 91`_ , where the traffic streams between VM-A and VM-B are distributed between Service VM-1 and Service VM-2. If Service VM-1 goes down, then all streams that are dependent on Service VM-1 will be moved to Service VM-2.

The following are the major features of load balancing in the service chain:

   - Load balancing can be configured at every level of the service chain.


   - Load balancing is supported in routed and bridged service chain modes.


   - Load balancing can be used to achieve high availability—if a service VM goes down, the traffic passing through that service VM can be distributed through another service VM.


   - A load balanced traffic stream always follows the same path through the chain of service VM.
