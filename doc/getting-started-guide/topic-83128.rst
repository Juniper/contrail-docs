Security Groups Overview
========================

A **security group** is a container for security group rules. Security groups and security group rules allow administrators to specify the type of traffic that is allowed to pass through a port. When a virtual machine (VM) is created in a virtual network (VN), a security group can be associated with the VM when it is launched. If a security group is not specified, a port is associated with a default security group. The default security group allows both ingress and egress traffic. Security rules can be added to the default security group to change the traffic behavior.


Creating Security Groups and Adding Rules
=========================================

A default security group is created for each project. You can add security rules to the default security group and you can create additional security groups and add rules to them. The security groups are then associated with a VM, when the VM is launched or at a later date.

To add rules to a security group:


#. From the OpenStack interface, click the **Project** tab, select **Access & Security** , and click the **Security Groups** tab.

   Any existing security groups are listed under the **Security Groups** tab, including the default security group; see `Figure 65`_ .

#. Select the **default-security-group** and click **Edit Rules** in the **Actions** column.

   The **Edit Security Group Rules** window is displayed; see `Figure 66`_ . Any rules already associated with the security group are listed.

#. Click **Add Rule** to add a new rule; see `Figure 67`_ .

   +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Column                            | Description                       |
   +===================================+===================================+
   | **IP Protocol**                   | Select the IP protocol to apply   |
   |                                   | for this rule: TCP, UDP, ICMP.    |
   +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | **From Port**                     | Select the port from which        |
   |                                   | traffic originates to apply this  |
   |                                   | rule. For TCP and UDP, enter a    |
   |                                   | single port or a range of ports.  |
   |                                   | For ICMP rules, enter an ICMP     |
   |                                   | type code.                        |
   +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | **To Port**                       | The port to which traffic is      |
   |                                   | destined that applies to this     |
   |                                   | rule, using the same options as   |
   |                                   | in the **From Port** field.       |
   +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | **Source**                        | Select the source of traffic to   |
   |                                   | be allowed by this rule. Specify  |
   |                                   | subnet—the CIDR IP address or     |
   |                                   | address block of the inter-domain |
   |                                   | source of the traffic that        |
   |                                   | applies to this rule, or you can  |
   |                                   | choose security group as source.  |
   |                                   | Selecting security group as       |
   |                                   | source allows any other instance  |
   |                                   | in that security group access to  |
   |                                   | any other instance via this rule. |

#. Click **Create Security Group** to create additional security groups.

   The **Create Security Group** window is displayed; see `Figure 68`_ .

   Each new security group has a unique 32-bit security group ID and an ACL is associated with the configured rules.

   .. _Figure 68:

#. When an instance is launched, there is an opportunity to associate a security group; see `Figure 69`_ .

   In the **Security Groups** list, select the security group name to associate with the instance.

#. You can verify that security groups are attached by viewing the ``SgListReq`` and ``IntfReq`` associated with the ``agent.xml`` .
