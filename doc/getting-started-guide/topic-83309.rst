Server Requirements
===================

The minimum requirement for a proof-of-concept (POC) system is 3 servers, either physical or virtual machines. All non-compute roles can be configured in each controller node. For scalability and availability reasons, it is highly recommended to use physical servers.

Each server must have a minimum of:

   - 64 GB memory


   - 300 GB hard drive


   - 4 CPU cores


   - At least one Ethernet port
