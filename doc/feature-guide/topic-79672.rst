Multi-Tier Web Application Overview
===================================

A common requirement for a cloud tenant is to create a tiered web application in leased cloud space. The tenant enjoys the favorable economics of a private IT infrastructure within a shared services environment. The tenant seeks speedy setup and simplified operations.

The following example shows how to set up a simple tiered web application using Contrail. The example has a web server that a user accesses by means of a public floating IP address. The front-end web server gets the content it serves to customers from information stored in a SQL database server that resides on a back-end network. The web server can communicate directly with the database server without going through any gateways. The public (or client) can only communicate to the web server on the front-end network. The client is not allowed to communicate directly with any other parts of the infrastructure. See `Figure 129`_ .

Example: Setting Up Virtual Networks for a Simple Tiered Web Application
========================================================================

This example provides basic steps for setting up a simple multi-tier network application. Basic creation steps are provided, along with links to the full explanation for each of the creation steps. Refer to the links any time you need more information about completing a step.


#. Working with a system that has the Contrail software installed and provisioned, create a project named **demo** .

   For more information; see `Creating Projects in OpenStack for Configuring Tenants in Contrail`_ .



#. In the **demo** project, create three virtual networks:

   - A network named **public** with IP address **10.84.41.0/24** 

      This is a special use virtual network for floating IP addresses— it is assigned an address block from the public floating address pool that is assigned to each web server. The assigned block is the only address block advertised outside of the data center to clients that want to reach the web services provided.


   - A network named **frontend** with IP address **192.168.1.0/24** 

      This network is the location where the web server virtual machine instances are launched and attached. The virtual machines are identified with private addresses that have been assigned to this virtual network.


   - A network named **backend** with IP address **192.168.2.0/24** 

      This network is the location where the database server virtual machines instances are launched and attached. The virtual machines are identified with private addresses that have been assigned to this virtual network.


   For more information; see `Creating a Virtual Network with OpenStack Contrail`_ or `Creating a Virtual Network with Juniper Networks Contrail`_ .



#. Create a floating IP pool named **public_pool** for the **public** network within the **demo** project; see `Figure 130`_ .

   .. _Figure 130: 

   *Figure 130* : Create Floating IP Pool

   .. figure:: s041841.gif



#. Allocate the floating IP pool **public_pool** to the **demo** project; see `Figure 131`_ .

   .. _Figure 131: 

   *Figure 131* : Allocate Floating IP

   .. figure:: s041842.gif



#. Verify that the floating IP pool has been allocated; see **Configure > Networking > Allocate Floating IPs.** 

   For more information; see `Creating a Floating IP Address Pool`_ and– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –.



#. Create a policy that allows any host to talk to any host using any IP address, protocol, and port, and apply this policy between the **frontend** network and the **backend** network.

   This now allows communication between the web servers in the front-end network and the database servers in the back-end network.

   For more information; see– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –,– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –, or– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –, and– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –.



#. Launch the virtual machine instances that represent the web server and the database server.


  .. note:: Your installation might not include the virtual machines needed for the web server and the database server. Contact your account team if you need to download the VMs for this setup.



On the **Instances** tab for this project, select **Launch Instance** and for each instance that you launch, complete the fields to make the following associations:

- Web server VM: select **frontend** network and the policy created to allow communication between **frontend** and **backend** networks. Apply the floating IP address pool to the web server.


- Database server VM: select **backend** network and the policy created to allow communication between **frontend** and **backend** networks.


For more information; see– EXTERNAL LINK. PLEASE RE-INSERT. –.



Verifying the Multi-Tier Web Application
========================================

Verify your web setup.


- To demonstrate this web application setup, go to the client machine, open a browser, and navigate to the address in the **public** network that is assigned to the web server in the **frontend** network.

   The result will display the Contrail interface with various data populated, verifying that the web server is communicating with the database server in the **backend** network and retrieving data.

   The client machine only has access to the public IP address. Attempts to browse to any of the addresses assigned to the **frontend** network or to the **backend** network should fail.



Sample Addressing Scheme for Simple Tiered Web Application
==========================================================

Use the information in `Table 32`_ as a guide for addressing devices in the simple tiered web example.
