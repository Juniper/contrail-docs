Monitoring the System
=====================

The **Monitor** icon on the Contrail Controller provides numerous options so you can view and analyze usage and other activity associated with all nodes of the system, through the use of reports, charts, and detailed lists of configurations and system activities.

Monitor pages support monitoring of infrastructure components—control nodes, virtual routers, analytics nodes, and config nodes. Additionally, users can monitor networking and debug components.

Use the menu options available from the **Monitor** icon to configure and view the statistics you need for better understanding of the activities in your system. See `Figure 205`_
