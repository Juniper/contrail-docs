Starting with Contrail Release 4.0, you can view a history of alarms that were raised or reset. You can also view a history of user-visible entities (UVEs) that have been changed.

Viewing Alarms History
----------------------

In the Contrail Web user interface, new fields at **Monitor > Alarms > Dashboard > Alarms History** now display alarms history, including alarms that were set or reset. `Figure 202`_ shows the alarms history, identifying the volume and types of alarms by time and the node types in which events are occurring. The right side panel lists by name the nodes in which active events are occurring.

You can also use a ``contrail-status`` query to view the alarms history. Additionally, the ``contrail-status`` displays a history of added, updated, and removed information for UVEs in Contrail.
