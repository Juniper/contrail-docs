This procedure has been validated with the following Contrail, Red Hat, and OpenStack versions.

 +------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------+
 | Contrail Version | Red Hat Version | OpenStack Version                      |
 +==================+=================+========================================+
 | 3.2.3            | RHEL 7.3        | RHOSP10 (packages dated Dec. 5, 2017)  |
 +------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------+
 | 3.2.6            | RHEL 7.4        | RHOSP10 (packages dated Feb. 2, 2018)  |
 +------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------+
 | 4.1              | RHEL 7.4        | RHOSP10 (packages dated Feb. 27, 2018) |
 +------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------+





Upgrade the Undercloud
----------------------

Upgrade the undercloud to the most current RHOSP10 version.


#. Log in to the undercloud as the stack user.

    ``su – stack`` 



#. Update the Contrail repositories.

    ``sudo rm –rf /etc/yum.repos.d/*contrail*`` 

    ``curl http://newrepo.contrail41-dev.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo`` 



#. Stop the main OpenStack platform services.

    ``sudo systemctl stop 'openstack-*' 'neutron-*' httpd`` 



#. Update the ``python-tripleoclient`` package and its dependencies to ensure you have the most current scripts for the minor version update.

    ``$ sudo yum update python-tripleoclient`` 



#. Upgrade the undercloud.

    ``$ openstack undercloud upgrade`` 



#. Reboot the node.

    ``$ sudo reboot`` 



#. Wait until the node reboots, then check the status of all services.


   .. note:: It can take as much as 10 minutes or more for the ``openstack-nova-compute`` to become active after a reboot.



   ``$ sudo systemctl list-units "openstack*" "neutron*" "openvswitch*"`` 



#. Verify the version of RHEL after the undercloud upgrade.

   ::

    [root@undercloud ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release 
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.4 (Maipo)
    [root@undercloud ~]# 




#. Check the versions of the RHOSP images to verify that the new images are available.

   In the following example, the new images are ``rhosp-director-images-ipa-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch`` and ``rhosp-director-images-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch`` .

   ::

    [root@undercloud ~]# rpm -qa | grep -i rhosp
    rhosp-director-images-ipa-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch
    rhosp-director-images-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch
    rhosp-director-images-ipa-10.0-20170615.1.el7ost.noarch
    rhosp-director-images-10.0-20170615.1.el7ost.noarch
    [root@undercloud ~]#




#. Verify the existence of the overcloud and its nodes.

    ``$ openstack stack list`` 

    ``$ ironic node-list`` 



#. Review the power status, provision state, and maintenance, ensuring:

   - Power state is set to Power on


   - Provision state is set to Active


   - Maintenance is set to False




#. Verify that all OpenStack servers are Active.

    ``$ openstack server list``

Update Red Hat Director Image Archives
--------------------------------------

The undercloud update process might download new image archives from the rhosp-director images and the rhosp-director-ipa packages. You’ll want to update your existing system with any new image archives.


#. Check the yum log to determine if new image archives are available.

    ``$ sudo grep "rhosp-director-images" /var/log/yum.log`` 
   ::

    [stack@undercloud ~]$ sudo grep "rhosp-director-images" /var/log/yum.log
    Feb 05 16:03:59 Installed: rhosp-director-images-ipa-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch
    Feb 05 16:04:54 Installed: rhosp-director-images-10.0-20180103.3.el7ost.noarch
    [stack@undercloud ~]$ 




#. If new image archives are available, replace your current images with the new images. Before deploying any new images, remove any existing images from the images undercloud on the stack user’s home (/home/stack/images).

    ``$ rm -rf ~/images/*`` 



#. Extract the new image archives.
   ::

    mkdir  images
    cd images 
    for i in /usr/share/rhosp-director-images/overcloud-full-latest-10.0.tar /usr/share/rhosp-director-images/ironic-python-agent-latest-10.0.tar; do tar -xvf $i; done




#. Install the Contrail package on the overcloud image by using the virt-customize command.
   ::

    export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct  /usr/bin/virt-customize  -a /home/stack/images/overcloud-full.qcow2 \
    --copy-in /etc/yum.repos.d/mylocalrepo.repo:/etc/yum.repos.d \
      --run-command 'yum -y install puppet-tripleo contrail-tripleo-puppet puppet-contrail‘\
      --run-command ‘ cp -r /usr/share/contrail-tripleo-puppet/ /usr/share/openstack-puppet/modules/tripleo/ ‘ \
      --run-command 'rm -fr /var/cache/yum/*' \
      --run-command 'yum clean all' \  --selinux-relabel 




#. Import the new image archives into the undercloud and configure nodes to use the new images.

    ``$ openstack overcloud image upload --update-existing --image-path /home/stack/images/`` 



#. Verify that the images are uploaded.

    ``$ glance image-list`` 


   .. figure:: s019930.png



#. Show the details of the new image that has been created. The new image will be used to add a new node in the overcloud.

    ``$ glance image-show overcloud-full`` 


   .. figure:: s019931.png



#. Observe the contrail-status on all Contrail nodes. All services in the Contrail nodes, except the controller (OpenStack), should be up and running before proceeding with the upgrade.

    ``[stack@undercloud ~]$ for i in $(nova list | grep contrail | awk '{print $12}' | cut -d '=' -f2); do ssh heat-admin@$i sudo contrail-status; done`` 




Prepare Repositories on all Nodes
---------------------------------




#. Delete existing repositories on all overcloud nodes. Be sure to verify each deletion.

    ``for ipnode in $(nova list | sed '4,$ !d;$d'| awk -F 'ctlplane=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '|'); do echo cleaning yum repolist on $ipnode && ssh heat-admin@$ipnode 'find /etc/yum.repos.d/ ! -name 'contrail-install.repo' -type f -exec sudo rm -f {} +' ; done`` 



#. Add new repositories on all overcloud nodes. Be sure to verify each addition.

    ``for ipnode in $(nova list | sed '4,$ !d;$d'| awk -F 'ctlplane=' '{print $2}' | tr -d '|'); do echo cleaning yum repolist on $ipnode && ssh heat-admin@$ipnode ' curl http://newrepo.contrail41-dev.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.rep' ; done`` 




Upgrade the Operating System on Contrail Nodes
----------------------------------------------




#. Define a list ($iplist) that contains all Contrail nodes.

    ``Iplist=” @IPcontrailController1 @IPContrailController2 …”`` 



#. Upgrade the operating system for all nodes in the iplist.

    ``for ipnode in $iplist; do echo -e "\n\n\t******upgrade node : $ipnode ******" && ssh heat-admin@$ipnode 'sudo yum update -y --disablerepo=*contrail* --skip-broken && exit' ; done`` 




Prepare the Contrail Packages
-----------------------------

Check the undercloud Contrail packages versions for ``contrail-tripleo-puppet`` , ``puppet-contrail`` , and ``contrail-tripleo-puppet`` . The newest versions of those packages must be installed before proceeding with the overcloud upgrade. See the following example, with current packages versions.

   ::

    [root@director-ctl ~]# rpm -qa | grep contrail
    contrail-tripleo-puppet-4.1.0.0-8.el7.noarch
    contrail-tripleo-heat-templates-4.1.0.0-8.el7.noarch
    puppet-contrail-4.1.0.0-8.el7.noarch




Upgrade the Contrail Heat Templates
-----------------------------------

You must copy the new Contrail Heat templates package to the undercloud node, while retaining a copy of the Heat templates that were used for the existing deployment.


#. Make a copy of all of the Heat templates that were used for deployment and save the copies, because the existing files will be overwritten by the new versions. The templates to copy are of the form contrail-services.yaml, contrail-net.yaml, and so on.



#. Copy the new contrail-tripleo-heat templates to the undercloud node.

   ::

    cp -r /usr/share/contrail-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail /home/stack/templates/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/
    cp -r /usr/share/contrail-tripleo-heat-templates/puppet/services/network/* /home/stack/templates/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/puppet/services/network 





Modify the Yum Update Script for TripleO Puppet
-----------------------------------------------

Before starting the upgrade, a few Puppet commands must be added to the yum_update script, located at:

 ``/home/stack/templates/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/extraconfig/tasks/yum_update.sh`` 


#. Update the following Puppet commands in the yum_update.sh. Refer to the following patch for details regarding the exact placement of the commands patch: https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-tripleo-heat-templates/blob/stable/newton/environments/contrail/yum_updates.patch 

    ``yum install -y contrail-tripleo-puppet puppet-contrail`` 

    ``rsync -a /usr/share/contrail-tripleo-puppet/ /usr/share/openstack-puppet/modules/tripleo/`` 



#. Ensure that the new version of the packages puppet-contrail and contrail-tripleo-puppet have been installed on the Contrail nodes, and that contrail-tripleo-puppet has been copied to openstack-puppet.

    ``rm -rf /usr/share/openstack-puppet/modules/tripleo/contrail-tripleo-puppet`` 

    ``cp -R /usr/share/contrail-tripleo-puppet/ /usr/share/openstack-puppet/modules/tripleo`` 



#. Update the fields ``*contrail version`` and ``*contrail repo`` in ``contrail-services.yaml`` .

   

   Filename: ``\templates/environments/contrail/contrail-services.yaml`` .

   Add the following parameters:

   ContrailVersion: 4

   ContrailRepo : *<location of the contrail-41 repo>*   




Update the Overcloud Deployment Plan
------------------------------------




#. Update the current plan by rerunning the command used for cloud deployment and adding the suffix ``- -update-plan-only`` .

   ::

    <openstack overcloud deploy> –update-plan-only

    Example   ::

    openstack overcloud deploy --update-plan-only --templates /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/ \
    --roles-file /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail/roles_data.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/puppet-pacemaker.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail/contrail-services.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail/network-isolation.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/contrail/contrail-net.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/ips-from-pool-all.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/environments/network-management.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/extraconfig/pre_deploy/rhel-registration/environment-rhel-registration.yaml \
    -e /home/stack/tripleo-heat-templates/extraconfig/pre_deploy/rhel-registration/rhel-registration-resource-registry.yaml \
    --libvirt-type qemu




#. Make a copy of the existing deploy script to the ``update-stack.sh`` . The ``update-stack.sh`` is the script used to update the overcloud plan, and it references the same templates that were used to deploy the stack. All files used for the overcloud update should be identical to the files used for deployment, with the exception of the ``contrail-services`` file that was updated with the latest ``contrail-version`` and ``contrail-repo`` .

    ``cp deploy.sh update-stack.sh`` 



#. Update the deployment plan.

    ``./update-stack.sh`` 




Upgrade Cautions
-----------------


.. caution:: The steps to perform the overcloud upgrade are service disrupting, and should only be performed within a maintenance window.





Potential Packages Failures
---------------------------

Read the following before proceeding with the overcloud upgrade. The upgrade may fail due to packages conflicts in Contrail nodes for analytics, analytics database, and Contrail controllers. Some observed failures due to packages conflicts are detailed in this section.



Analytics Database Failure
--------------------------

You may encounter a Cassandra package version conflict issue.

Error message: cassandra22 conflicts with cassandra-3.10-0contrail0.el7.centos.noarch

Solution: Remove the cassandra22 package.

 ``sudo rpm -e --nodeps cassandra22-2.2.8-1.noarch`` 



Analytics Node Failure
----------------------

Error message: ``file /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/redis/__init__.py from install of python-redis-2.10.3-3.el7ost.noarch conflicts with file from package redis-py-0.1-2contrail.el7.noarch``  

Solution: Remove the redis-py package.

 ``sudo rpm -e python-redis-2.10.3-3.el7ost.noarch`` 



Contrail Controller Failure
---------------------------

Error message: ``cassandra22 conflicts with cassandra-3.10-0contrail0.el7.centos.noarch``  

Solution: Remove the cassandra22 package.

 ``sudo rpm -e --nodeps cassandra22-2.2.8-1.noarch`` 


.. note:: You can delete redis-py from the analytics node, and delete cassandra22 from the analytics database and the Contrail controllers node.





Contrail vRouter Package Conflict
----------------------------------

Error message: ``/etc/init.d/contrail-vrouter-nodemgr conflicts between attempted installs of contrail-openstack-vrouter-4.1.0.0-8.el7.noarch and contrail-vrouter-agent-4.1.0.0-8.el7.x86_64``  

Solution: Remove the contrail-openstack-vrouter.

 ``yum remove contrail-openstack-vrouter`` 



Analytics Node snmp-lib Version Conflict
-----------------------------------------

Error message: ``duplicate versions of net-snmp-libs -> net-snmp-libs-5.7.2-28.el7_4.1.x86_64 is a duplicate with 1:net-snmp-libs-5.7.2-28.el7.i686``  

Solution:

 ``rpm -e --nodeps net-snmp-libs`` 



Upgrade the Overcloud
---------------------


.. caution:: The steps in this section are service disrupting, and should only be performed within a maintenance window.

Contrail Service Recovery After Upgrade
---------------------------------------

Upon completing the upgrade, you might have some Contrail services reporting status down on some nodes. this section provides recovery suggestions for different services.



Contrail Controller Services
----------------------------

In a recent upgrade, the following services were down in the Contrail controller nodes.

   - contrail-control — failed


   - contrail-dns — failed


To determine the root cause of these failures, check the Contrail logs in ``/var/log/contrail/`` .

In this example, it was the IFMap and Discovery services causing the failures, because those services are no longer used in the Contrail 4.x releases.





Solution
--------


#. Remove the IFMap and Discover configuration sections from:

   -  ``/etc/contrail/contrail-control.conf`` 


   -  ``/etc/contrail/contrail-dns.conf`` 




#. Restart the services contrail-controller and contrail-dns.

   -  service contrail-control restart     


   -  service contrail-dns restart 




#. Verify that the services contrail-controller and contrail-dns are up and running after the restart.

   -  contrail-status     





Contrail Compute Services
-------------------------

On the Contrail compute node, the ``contrail-vrouter-agent`` service might be down after the upgrade. The vrouter agent is dependent on the kernel module. The RHEL7.3 has been upgraded to RHEL7.4, and the node needs to b rebooted to ensure the correct kernel module gets loaded.


#. Reboot the node.



#. After reboot, restart the vrouter service..

    service supervisor-vrouter restart 



#. Verify that all Contrail services are up and running.

    contrail-status
