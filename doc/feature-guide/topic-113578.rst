Node Memory and CPU Information
===============================

To help in monitoring and debugging, the following statistics have been added for all node types. The statistics are updated every 60 seconds.

- System CPU info


- System memory and CPU usage


- Memory and CPU usage of all processes


You can see a current sample from the UVE in your system at:

``http://<analytics-ip>:8081/analytics/uves/<node-type>/<hostname>?flat`` 

You can also use the statistics tables to get historical data with all supported aggregations, such as SUM, AVG, and so on:

-  ``NodeStatus.process_mem_cpu_usage`` 


-  ``NodeStatus.system_mem_cpu_usage`` 


The schema for the tables are at the following locations on your system:

``http://<analytics-ip>:8081/analytics/table/StatTable.NodeStatus.process_mem_cpu_usage/schema``  

``http://<analytics-ip>8081/analytics/table/StatTable.NodeStatus.system_mem_cpu_usage/schema``
