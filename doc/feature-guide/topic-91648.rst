Debugging Ping Failures for Policy-Connected Networks
=====================================================

This topic presents troubleshooting scenarios and steps for resolving reachability issues (ping failures) when working with policy-connected virtual networks.

These are the methods used to configure reachability for a virtual network or virtual machine:

   - Use network policy to exchange virtual network routes.


   - Use a floating IP address pool to associate an IP address from a destination virtual network to virtual machine(s) in the source virtual network.


   - Use an ASN/RT configuration to exchange virtual network routes with an MX Series router gateway.


   - Use a service instance static route configuration to route between service instances in two virtual networks.


This topic focuses on troubleshooting reachability for the first method --- using network policy to exchange routes between virtual networks.

 *Troubleshooting Procedure for Policy-Connected Network* 


#. Check the state of the virtual machine and interface.

   Before doing anything else, check the status of the source and destination virtual machines.

   - Is the **Status** of each virtual machine **Up** ?


   - Are the corresponding tap interfaces **Active** ?


   Check the virtual machine status in the Contrail UI:

   .. _Figure 277: 

     *Figure 277* : Virtual Machine Status Window

   .. figure:: s041980.gif

   Check the tap interface status in the http agent introspect, for example: http://nodef1.englab.juniper.net:8085/Snh_ItfReq?name= 

   .. _Figure 278: 

     *Figure 278* : Tap Interface Status Window

   .. figure:: s041981.gif

   When the virtual machine status is verified **Up** , and the tap interface is **Active** , you can focus on other factors that affect traffic, including routing, network policy, security policy, and service instances with static routes.



#. Check reachability and routing.

   Use the following troubleshooting guidelines whenever you are experiencing ping failures on virtual network routes that are connected by means of network policy.

   Check the network policy configuration:

   - Verify that the policy is attached to each of the virtual networks.


   - Each attached policy should have either an explicit rule allowing traffic from one virtual network to the other, or an allow all traffic rule.


   - Verify that the order of the actions in the policy rules is correct, because the actions are applied in the order in which they are listed.


   - If there are multiple policies attached to a virtual network, verify that the policies are attached in a logical order. The first policy listed is applied first, and its rules are applied first, then the next policy is applied.


   - Finally, if either of the virtual networks does not have an explicit rule to allow traffic from the other virtual network, the traffic flow will be treated as an **UNRESOLVED** or **SHORT** flow and all packets will be dropped.


   Use the following sequence in the Contrail UI to check policies, attachments, and traffic rules:

   Check VN1-VN2 ACL information from the compute node:

   .. _Figure 279: 

     *Figure 279* : Policies, Attachments, and Traffic Rule Status Window

   .. figure:: s041982.gif

   Check the virtual network policy configuration with route information:

   .. _Figure 280: 

     *Figure 280* : Virtual Network Policy Configuration Window

   .. figure:: s041983.gif

   Check the VN1 route information for VN2 routes:

   .. _Figure 281: 

     *Figure 281* : Virtual Network Route Information Window

   .. figure:: s041984.gif

   If a route is missing, ping fails. Flow inspection in the compute node displays **Action: D(rop)** .

   Repeated dropstats commands confirms the drop by incrementing the **Flow Action Drop** counter with each iteration of dropstats.

   Flow and dropstats commands issued at the compute node:

   .. _Figure 282: 

     *Figure 282* : Flow and Dropstats Command List

   .. figure:: s041985.gif

   To help in debugging flows, you can use the detailed flow query from the agent introspect page for the compute node.

   Fields of interest include:

   - Inputs [from **flow –l** output]: **src/dest ip, src/dest ports, protoco** l, and **vrf** 


   - Output from detailed flow query: **short_flow, src_vn, action_str->action** 


   Flow command output:

   .. _Figure 283: 

     *Figure 283* : Flow Command Output Window

   .. figure:: S041986.gif

   Fetching details of a single flow:

   .. _Figure 284: 

     *Figure 284* : Fetch Flow Record Window

   .. figure:: S041987.gif

   Output from **FetchFlowRecord** shows unresolved IP addresses:

   .. _Figure 285: 

     *Figure 285* : Unresolved IP Address Window

   .. figure:: S041988.gif

   You can also retrieve information about unresolved flows from the Contrail UI, as shown in the following:

   .. _Figure 286: 

     *Figure 286* : Unresolved Flow Details Window

   .. figure:: S041989.gif



#. Check for protocol-specific network policy action.

   If you are still experiencing reachability issues, troubleshoot any protocol-specific action, where routes are exchanged, but only specific protocols are allowed.

   The following shows a sample query on a protocol-specific flow in the agent introspect:

   .. _Figure 287: 

     *Figure 287* : Protocol-Specific Flow Sample

   .. figure:: S041991.gif

   The following shows that although the virtual networks are resolved (not **__UNKNOWN__** ), and not a short flow (the flow entry exists for a defined aging time), the policy action clearly displays **deny** as the action.

 *Summary* 

This topic explores one area —debugging for policy-based routing. However, in a complex system, a virtual network might have one or more configuration methods combined that influence reachability and routing.

For example, an environment might have a virtual network VN-X configured with policy-based routing to another virtual network VN-Y. At the same time, there are a few virtual machines in VN-X that have a floating IP to another virtual network VN-Z, which is connected to VN-XX via a NAT service instance. This is a complex scenario, and you need to debug step-by-step, taking into account all of the features working together.

Additionally, there are other considerations beyond routing and reachability that can affect traffic flow. For example, the rules of network policies and security groups can affect traffic to the destination. Also, if multi-path is involved, then ECMP and RPF need to be taken into account while debugging.
