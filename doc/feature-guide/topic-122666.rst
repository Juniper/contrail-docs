Bidirectional Forwarding and Detection Health Check over Virtual Machine Interfaces
===================================================================================



Contrail Release 4.1 adds support for BFD-based health checks for VMIs.

Health check for VMIs is already supported as poll-based checks with ping and curl commands. When enabled, these health checks run periodically, once every few seconds. Consequently, failure detection times can be quite large, always in seconds.

Health checks based on the BFD protocol provide failure detection and recovery in sub-second intervals, because applications are notified immediately upon BFD session state changes.
